I am currently pursuing a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University. My current research involves utilizing computer simulation and physics-informed machine learning techniques to construct design parameters for novel thermal management of next generation of high power density nanoscale technologies. Also, I conducted the first analysis of the full environmental footprints (carbon, water, and land) of Bitcoin mining and led an international study to investigate the extent of COVID-19 impact on their lives and research, based on their career stage, gender, marital status, etc; revealing early evidence of disproportional impact on female researchers and parents.</p> <p>I have authored five publications, presented and contributed to 14 conferences (including two best poster awards) and 3 more pending publications.</p> <p>Prior to my PhD, I completed my MASc. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Toronto with a CGPA of 4.0/4.0, and my BASc. in Mechanical Engineering (High Honors graduate) with a minor in Sustainability from the same university.</p> <p>I am also an advocate for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) and have been involved in several committees and task forces. For instance, I represented more than 7,000 graduate students on the university-wide COVID-19 task force, where I assisted with formalization of communication channels between in-person research tasks; mitigating potential health risks while optimizing research efficiency. I have also led efforts on incorporating DEI training into graduate engineering curriculum and for committee members of PhD oral qualification exams (∼40 students/year), and was awarded the Jeremiah Mpagazehe Award for my service and contributions to the graduate student community.</p> <p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I have also been involved in professional service, including serving as a liaison for all 180 doctoral students on meetings with the Department Head and graduation education committee, and on university-level committees such as the academic affair and academic calendar committees. I have also served as a lecturer and taught a mandatory first-year mechanical and industrial engineering course, where I designed the syllabus, delivered the lectures, invited guest speakers, and evaluated students.</p> </body></html>

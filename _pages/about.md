I'm a Mechanical Engineer, Sustainable Energy Researcher, and DEI Advocate.

My research encompasses a range of areas such as computational nanoscale mechanics, transport phenomena in soft and active matter, and efficient molecular simulation. Although these are my primary focus areas, my interests and experience extend further. I have been involved in experimental research in nanoscale heat transfer, material discovery and characterization, and nanofabrication. Additionally, I've delved into energy policy, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), and equity in education.

Prior to my PhD, I completed my MASc. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Toronto as an NSERC scholar and Russell A. Reynolds Fellow in Thermodynamics, and my BASc. in Mechanical Engineering (High Honors graduate) with a minor in Sustainability from the same university. 

I am also an advocate for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) and have been involved in several committees and task forces. For instance, I represented more than 7,000 graduate students on the university-wide COVID-19 task force, where I assisted with formalization of communication channels between in-person research tasks; mitigating potential health risks while optimizing research efficiency. I have also led efforts on incorporating DEI training into graduate engineering curriculum and for committee members of PhD oral qualification exams (âˆ¼40 students/year), and was awarded the Jeremiah Mpagazehe Award for my service and contributions to the graduate student community.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have also been involved in professional service, including serving as a liaison for all 180 doctoral students on meetings with the Department Head and graduation education committee, and on university-level committees such as the academic affair and academic calendar committees. I have also served as a lecturer and taught a mandatory first-year mechanical and industrial engineering course, where I designed the syllabus, delivered the lectures, invited guest speakers, and evaluated students.

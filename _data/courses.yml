    The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the principles and practice of molecular simulation. These computational methods are useful for studying a broad range of engineering phenomena with atomic scale resolution, and are essential for investigating small scale systems that are not governed by continuum models (e.g. Navier Stokes, Fourier, Euler Bernoulli, etc.). This course focuses primarily on two major classes of molecular simulation methods: Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC); other techniques for micro and nanoscale simulation are briefly introduced at the end of the semester.
